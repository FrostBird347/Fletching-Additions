no___: what it can't go with if one of them is a stick or effect
req__: what it must go with, the type does not matter","Custom Stats


""@"" seperates stats
""&"" seperates stat options

Excuse the painful to read formatting, a script is used to convert this spreadsheet into a folder of recipies containing every possible valid combination (stats are applied via custom NBT).

Note that tips should generally have the biggest impact on damage + impact effects, sticks impact gravity + integrity + draw speed, fins impact flying speed. However they don't have to stick to this rule.
Also note that damage calculations will revert the flySpeed multiplier.
Finally, damage mult only applies to the damage the arrow does directly, things like firework explosion damage are unaffected

Note that ModelType/TextureID are different depending on the item type (e.g ""Blaze"" stick and effect textures are different)"
